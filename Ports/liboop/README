Liboop is a low-level event loop management library for POSIX-based operating systems. It supports the development of modular, multiplexed applications which may respond to events from several sources. It replaces the "select() loop" and allows the registration of event handlers for file and network I/O, timers and signals. Since processes use these mechanisms for almost all external communication, liboop can be used as the basis for almost any application.

Similar free software includes the GLib Main Event Loop, Niels Provos' libevent, and (for Perl) POE. Refer to the rationale for a detailed comparison.

Software which uses or supports liboop includes lsh, RULI, lyskom-server, Gale and GDN. (Let me know if I'm missing any.)
